      About
    </h2>
    <p>
      I'm a gardener, farmhand and aspiring farmer. On this site, I want to talk about low-tech growing methods, as I learn about them. I also have some critical things to say about industrial agriculture. I'm far from an expert but anyone can make things up on the internet.
