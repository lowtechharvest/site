        One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone
        in a world of wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to
        laymen. An ecologist must either harden his shell and make believe that
        the consequences of science are none of his business, or he must be the doctor
        who sees the marks of death in a community that believes itself well and
        does not want to be told otherwise.
